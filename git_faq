1. How do I initialize a project for git?

git init


2. How do I clone an existing project?

git clone [url]

3. How do I commit files to the repository?

git add [file]     #for every file that you want to commit.  Must add to staging area first.
git commit         #once all the files you want to commit are in the staging area.  can also do git commit -m 'message  here' if you don't want to use text editor to add message


4. How do I get at previous commits if I want to work with them?

git checkout [commit id or branch label]

5. How do I reset the current working directory to the most recent commit?

git checkout master   #checks out branch labeled master.  can also checkout other branches you have created


6. How do I fork/branch my code?  

git branch [branch_name]    #to create a new label for the branch.  can also check out which branches you have with git branch
git checkout [new_branch_name]   #to give current working directory the new branch lable

or

git checkout -b [branch_name]   #creates branch label and assigns it to current working files.   Still need to stage and commit to make it permenant



7. How do I merge two branches?

First, you need to make sure you are working with the branch into which you want to merge the other branch.
	git checkout [merge_to_branch]

Next, you need to merge the other branch into the current branch
	git merge [branch_to_be_merged_in]  [current_branch]

finally, you can delete the label for the old branch
	git branch -d [branch_to_delete]

if there are problems with mergeing, the files will be marked up to resolve conflicts manually.  Once you close the text editor, the merge will go through

If you want to abort a merge with conflicts
	git merge --abort


8. What if I want to see what files are staged, what files commited, what files with changes not commited?

git status

11. How do I configure git?

git configure    #is the basic configuration command.  Typing this will bring up help for congfigure.

git configure -l  #shows all current configurations

Key ones to set:

git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"
git config core.editor notepad                               #this configures notepad for commits.  Can give path of another text editor like sublime
git config --global credential.helper wincred                #sets windows to store credentials for pushing to remote repository


12. How do I configure git bash?

You must add configurations to the .bashrc file in yor home directory (cd ~)

You can also do this from git bash using something like:

echo 'alias subl="C:/Program\ Files/Sublime\ Text\ 2/sublime_text.exe"' >> ~/.bashrc    #this sets subl as an alias to launch sublime_text.exe  by piping it into .bashrc
