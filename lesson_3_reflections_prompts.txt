1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

For a few reasons:
- projects with multiple contributors
- when you are working on multiple machines and need to keep project files up to date
- for safety
- to share your work with others


New Git Commands - Lesson 3:

* git remote								: shows existing remote repositories for project
* git remote -v								: same as git remote but with more information(i.e. verbose)    
* git remote add [name (origin)] [url]   	: adds a remote using name.  Usually if the project only has one remote it is called 'origin'.  [url] refers to the url where the repository will be located (usually on github)
* git push [remote_name] [branch_name]		: pushes [branch_name] from local repository to [remote_name]
