1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

For a few reasons:
- projects with multiple contributors
- when you are working on multiple machines and need to keep project files up to date
- for safety
- to share your work with others

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If the local repository was automatically updated to match the remote, there is the possiblity that a change on the remote that you didn't want would overwrite your local repository.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks: are made on GitHub website.  They make a copy of an existing project and are used for creating variations on existing projects without effecting the original project

Clones: are copies pulled from online repositories to local machines.  You can also clone from one directory to another.  You use clones when you want to create your own seperate version of a project or to pull from an online fork of another project.

Branches: are alternate versions of a project.  They can be used to try out new features, fix bugs, or any other purpose where a new (possibly temporary) version of the project is needed.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It allows git to compare the state of the local master to the state of the remote when it was last pulled.  This makes it possible to see if the master has gotten ahead and can be used for comparing changes between remote, local, and last time remote was pulled into local.  For instance, when pulling files from the remote after differing changes have been made to the same file on both remote and local.

5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I would probably used a cloud storage service such as google, onedrive, or dropbox to share files.  It would be easier for people to learn how to use, but it would be much harder to manage different versions of docs.  The best method would be to have one person in charge of making official updates and then have people put their proposed changes in their own working diretories.  This would get very complicated to manage for large, complex projects, even though getting started would be easier.

6. When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

If you are making significant changes, you might want to use a seperate branch.  So you wouldn't use branches for core features and standard bug fixes, but you would use them for major rewrites, major bug fixes, and non-core features or experimental features.

* You can also use branches when making changes to a public project so that you can keep your master up to date with main project and then use the branch for pull requests.


7. When do you use pull requests on GitHub?
pull requests are made when you want to propose changes to the master repository (or the main repository of a fork).  The owner of the repository can view your pull request, make comments, and then accept the request, merging your branch into the master.

multiple pull requests can be used by people working on a file.  In this case, conflicts between different versions will have to be resolved. 

This is done by accepting one change.  Then others must pull down those changes into their local master repositories, merge with their changes, and then push back up to their branch--which updates their pull request.  The repository owner can then accept these and merge them into the main.  Then everyone needs to pull the updated main version.


New Git Commands - Lesson 3:

* git remote								: shows existing remote repositories for project
* git remote -v								: same as git remote but with more information(i.e. verbose)    
* git remote add [name (origin)] [url]   	: adds a remote using name.  Usually if the project only has one remote it is called 'origin'.  [url] refers to the url where the repository will be located (usually on github)
* git push [remote_name] [branch_name]		: pushes [branch_name] from local repository to [remote_name]
* git pull [remote_name] [branch_name]      : pulls [branch_name]  from the remote into the local repository.  This updates whatever was in the repository.
* git fetch [remote_name (origin)] 			:  will update the origin/master branch but not the master branch
                                               useufl for when you have different changes to the same file on local and remote.  can then do a comparison with something like git diff origin/master master before creating a merge
